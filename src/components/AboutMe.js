            <p id="about-p">I'm a self-taught front-end developer in the making with a passion for lifelong learning
                about programming and human languages alike. I've made projects that showcase my HTML, CSS, 
                JavaScript, and React JS skills. I'm motivated to improve as a developer through hard work 
                and hands-on experiences. My long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer and learn as many
                intricacies of computer programming as I can.
