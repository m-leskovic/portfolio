      <p id="about-p">
        I'm a self-taught front-end developer with a passion for lifelong
        learning about programming and human languages alike. I've put my
        programming skills to the test through various personal projects. I'm
        motivated to improve as a developer through continued hard work and
        hands-on experiences. My long-term goal is to become a full-stack
        developer and learn as many intricacies of computer programming as I
        can.
